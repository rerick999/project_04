# project_04

Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned.
    We used the following models:  xgb boost, meural network, logistic regression, gradient boost, random forest, decision tree.

You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
    We used tensorflow, sklearn, and keras.

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 10,000 records.
    Our recordset is about 8500 records of mushroom data, poisonous v edible.  We're a little shy of 10k.

You must use Pandas and Matplotlib
    A pandas and maplotlib notebook is in 05_pandas_matplotlib

You must use a database (Can just store into PostgreSQL or a SQLite file - no need to retrieve your data from it)
    Our postgresql database is located at database-1.chmbbjazziaf.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com port 5432
    A readonly user is bootcamp_readonly password truly


You must use GCP or AWS (This can be as simple as saving your CSV to S3)
    we used a free tier postgresql database on AWS
    
You must either use Javascript (Plotly/Leaflet) OR Tableau
    A tableau chart is presented here:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robert.erick6346/viz/MushroomModels/mushroommodels
